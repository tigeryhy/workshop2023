## About

Welcome to the Third DialDoc Workshop co-located with [ACL 2023](https://2023.aclweb.org).

DialDoc workshop focuses on Document-Grounded Dialogue and Conversational Question Answering.
Given the vast amount of content created every day in various mediums, it is a meaningful yet challenging task not only
to make such content _accessible_ to end users via various conversational interfaces but also to make sure the responses
provided by the models are _grounded_ and _faithful_ with respect to the knowledge sources. The purpose of this workshop
is to invite researchers and practitioners to bring their individual perspectives on the subject of grounded dialogue
and conversational question answering to advance the field in a joint effort. We also host a shared task on grounded
dialogue based on multilingual documents, which aims to extend the current advances to languages other than English.

Topics of interests include but not limited to

- Document-grounded dialogue and conversational machine reading;
- Knowledge-grounded dialogue generation with pre-trained language models;
- Open domain dialogue and conversational QA;
- Topical open-domain conversational chat;
- Parsing semi-structured document content for dialogue and conversational QA, table reading;
- Evaluation for document-grounded dialogue;
- Interpretability and faithfulness in dialogue modeling;
- Dialogue summarization and query-based summarization.

## Calls

We welcome submissions of original work as long or short papers, as well as non-archival papers. We also accept paper
submissions via ARR. All accepted papers will be presented at the workshop.

We will have the Best Paper Award and Best Student Paper Award, which will be announced during the workshop.

### Submission Instructions

Formatting Guidelines:
We accept long (eight pages plus unlimited references) and short (four pages plus unlimited references) papers, which
should conform to ARR CFP guidelines.

Non-Archival Submissions:
The accepted papers can opt to be non-archival.

Stay tuned for more details about submission site.

### Review Process

All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least two reviewers. The reviewing process will be two-way anonymized.
Authors are responsible for anonymizing their submissions.

## Shared Task

This Challenge aims to address the issue that existing document-grounded dialogue datasets only focus on high-resource languages, such as Chinese and English. We aim to explore how to improve the performance of other languages, such as Vietnamese and French, with limited annotated data. For the first time, we provide training and evaluation data for document-grounded dialogue in Vietnamese and French, and organize the currently available Chinese and English document-grounded dialogue data. We hope that participants can leverage the linguistic similarities, for example, a large number of Vietnamese words are derived from Chinese, and English and French both belong to the Indo-European language family, to improve their models' performance in Vietnamese and French.


### Training Data
We provide 797 dialogues in Vietnamese (3,446 turns), 816 dialogues in French (3,510 turns), and a corpus of 17272 paragraphs in ModelScope, where each dialogue turn is grounded in a paragraph from the corpus. In addition, we offer 5760 turns in Chinese and 26,506 turns in English. 

### Competition Website
The competition is hosted on the Tianchi platform at https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/entrance/532063/information?lang=en-us 

### Baseline & Data Downloads
We have also provided a baseline model, which can be found at https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/DAMO-ConvAI/tree/main/acl23doc2dial. 

### Important Dates
The challenge includes leaderboards for two task settings with two phases, Dev (TestDev) and Test phase,

- Datasets ready & Baseline Models : February 6, 2023
- Dev Phase Start : February 17, 2023
- Test Phase Start : March 25, 2023
- Date of Leaderboard submissionï¼šMarch 31, 2023
- Paper submission: April 24, 2023
